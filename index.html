        District 35 Democratic Councilmember Crystal Hudson is
        <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/district-35/">running</a>
        for re-election this year with affordability at the forefront of her campaign in Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill residents.
      </p>
      <p class="dek">
        But, her challengers are campaigning with promises of more aggressive affordable housing production, tougher policing and stronger community oversight.

        <h2 class="subhed">Affordability and anti-displacement</h2>
        <p>The escalating pressures of gentrification has motivated Hudson to continue prioritizing affordability of housing, utilities, childcare and taxes in her re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>
          Over two decades, the white population in District 35 tripled, while the Black population decreased by 40%,
          <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/crystal-hudson/wp-content/uploads/sites/117/2023/06/D35-Neighborhood-Snapshot-–-Digital.pdf">according to Hudson’s office</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Households in the area are experiencing a significant rent burden, spending over 30% of their income on rent. Evictions have been notably high in parts of Crown Heights and Fort Greene since 2019.</p>
        <p class="pull">“We are not talking about gentrification now—gentrification has already come and maybe already gone,” Hudson said. “Everybody is struggling—nothing is affordable.”</p>
        <p>Hudson’s has <a href="https://www.bkreader.com/featured-news/meet-your-candidates-district-35-race-heats-up-with-four-contenders-10435090">prioritized</a> preserving tenant protections, resisting piecemeal rezonings without community input, and promoting a coordinated, large-scale affordable housing plan.</p>
        <p>She <a href="https://www.crystalforbk.com/">opposed</a> a proposal for a 150-unit, mixed-use development at <span class="stat"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/nyregion/housing-reporter.html">962 Pacific Street</a></span>, arguing that such projects should wait until they align with a broader neighborhood rezoning plan.</p>
        <p>She <a href="https://intro.nyc/councilmembers/crystal-hudson">introduced</a> legislation like the senior citizen and disability rent increase exemptions.</p>

      <section class="section-block">
        <h2 class="subhed">Climate and sustainability policies</h2>
        <p>Hudson doesn’t emphasize climate change as her signature issue. But, she has a history of <a href="https://workersworldtoday.com/crystal-hudson-charting-a-progressive-path-forward-in-nyc-politics/">supporting</a> the integration of green building standards and investing in heat mitigation and public transit and bike infrastructure to reduce emissions in her district.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-block">
        <h2 class="subhed">Reproductive health and social services</h2>
        <p>Hudson has progressive stances on reproductive health, <a href="https://www.crystalforbk.com/">supporting</a> accessible contraception, protection of legal abortion and expanding maternal health services in underserved neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>She has also <a href="https://www.crystalforbk.com/">championed</a> social investments for Black communities through her Black Agenda, which includes health equity, mental health access, and community-based support.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-block">
        <h2 class="subhed">Background and challenges ahead</h2>
        <p>As a third-generation Brooklynite and the daughter of Jamaican and Honduran immigrants, Hudson <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/crystal-hudson/bio/">became</a> the first openly gay Black woman elected to the New York City Council in January 2022. Caring for her mother with Alzheimer’s <a href="https://brooklyn.news12.com/incumbent-councilwoman-crystal-hudson-seeks-another-term-for-city-council">motivated</a> her political career, pushing her to navigate and challenge public systems.</p>
        <p>But, some believe Hudson has <a href="https://www.brooklynpaper.com/nyc-primaries-meet-candidates-district-35/">too moderate</a> of an approach to rezonings, which has potentially slowed development, as she faces Dion Michael Ashman, Hector Robertson, and Kenny Lever in this year’s election.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-block watch-for">
        <h2 class="subhed">Voters in Crown Heights should be on lookout for:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hudson pushing a multi-neighborhood rezoning plan that ensures affordable housing rather than approving isolated projects.</li>
          <li>Stronger tenant protections and exemptions.</li>
          <li>Establishing better climate resilience and green infrastructure in historically underinvested blocks.</li>
          <li>Stronger oversight of city agencies and development resistance that may displace long-term residents.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="kicker-note">Nonetheless, Hudson is still viewed as the most politically experienced in the field, with more potential influence in Council leadership if re-elected.</p>
